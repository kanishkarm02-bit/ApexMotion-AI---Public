## 🧠 Inspiration

Elite athletes have access to biomechanical experts, performance labs, and professional coaching. Most people don’t. ApexMotionAI was built to bridge that gap — bringing intelligent, real-time sports movement analysis to anyone with a camera. Our mission is to democratize performance optimization and injury prevention using advanced AI.

---

## ⚡ What It Does

ApexMotionAI is an AI-powered performance engine that:

- Analyzes sports movements through live or uploaded video  
- Detects joint positions using computer vision  
- Calculates biomechanical angles in real time  
- Identifies form errors and inefficiencies  
- Predicts potential injury risks  
- Provides instant corrective feedback  
- Generates a performance score  
- Tracks progress over time  
- Gamifies improvement with levels, streaks, and achievements  

It transforms raw motion data into actionable coaching insights within seconds.
